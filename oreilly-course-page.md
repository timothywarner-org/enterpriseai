## Course Overview

AI is transforming enterprise IT. In this live training, Tim Warner demonstrates how to fully architect and deploy production-ready AI solutions on Azure, with explicit patterns for AWS and Google Cloud practitioners. You'll master Azure OpenAI Service, implement enterprise security with private endpoints, and accelerate development using GitHub Copilot. Every pattern comes from real Fortune 500 deployments where security and scale weren't optional. All patterns meet SOC2, ISO27001, and HIPAA compliance requirements without architectural redesign, ensuring solutions pass enterprise audits on first deployment.

As a Microsoft MVP, Tim Warner knows what's needed to succeed, and provides working code, architecture diagrams, and the confidence to deploy AI that actually ships to production.

## What You'll Learn

- Learn production patterns for AI deployment that can also be used on AWS and GCP
- Take a security-first approach with private endpoints, virtual networks (VNets), and compliance built into every demo
- Use Copilot integration to combine infrastructure deployment with AI-powered development

### Key Learning Outcomes

- Deploy Azure OpenAI behind private endpoints to meet enterprise security requirements without sacrificing functionality
- Translate any Azure AI service to its AWS/GCP equivalent using provided mapping guides and architectural patterns
- Generate production-ready infrastructure code 70% faster using GitHub Copilot with Azure-specific prompts
- Implement cost controls and monitoring that prevent runaway AI spending while maintaining performance
- Access production-tested Bicep templates, security configuration scripts, and cost-monitoring dashboards used by Fortune 500 teams, saving 3-4 weeks of development time per project

## Who Should Attend

This live event is for you if:

- You're an Azure architect or admin tasked with deploying AI services but unsure how to meet enterprise security requirements
- You're a DevOps engineer who needs to integrate AI into existing CI/CD pipelines without breaking compliance
- You work in a multi-cloud environment and need to understand how Azure AI patterns translate to AWS or GCP
- You're tired of toy demos and need production-ready patterns that work in regulated industries

## Prerequisites

- **Azure fundamentals:** Working knowledge of Azure portal, resource groups, and subscriptions (AZ-900 level is good)
- **Basic networking:** Understanding of IP addresses, DNS, and virtual networks
- **Command line comfort:** Ability to run Azure CLI or PowerShell commands
- **Development basics (helpful, not required):** Familiarity with Visual Studio Code and Git
- **Access requirements:** Azure subscription (free tier works), GitHub account (trial gives access to Copilot)

## Course Setup

Required if you'd like to participate in the hands-on portion of the training:

- Azure subscription (trial is OK)
- VS Code + Azure/GitHub Copilot extensions
- Git, Azure CLI
- GitHub account (trial is OK)
- Course repo: github.com/timothywarner

**Note:** Azure OpenAI may require preview access approval.
